2,NoLinks,Ring,1,5,2,5,2,3,7,1,3,2,"In the ring visualization, I liked being able to rotate the rings individually and I feel that the rings were a better way to connect related data.","In the scatterplot visualization, I disliked how randomly the data seemed to be placed.",
6,NoLinks,Ring,1,7,1,4,1,1,7,4,1,4,"They look cool, manipulable, easy to use",Counting was difficult,
10,NoLinks,Ring,1,1,1,7,1,7,5,5,1,1,liked how you could see the connections ,"for scatterplot, harder to organize ",
14,NoLinks,Ring,3,5,2,5,3,5,5,3,5,5,Both visualizations were easy to manipulate and view from multiple point of views,Some of the rings were very cluttered with nodes which made it a little difficult to tell one node from another,The visualizations were pretty great. The space around could be extended a little further or the graphs could be placed more towards the center of the virtual room for better examination
18,NoLinks,Ring,3,3,2,6,2,3,6,2,7,5,I liked that you could move the scatterplot nodes around because it made it easier for some questions. I liked that the ring visualization made publishers very clear.,"I wish there was a way to reset position of scatterplot nodes (maybe even with links of selected nodes shown) because it is easy to lose track of where nodes were moved. I also wish there was a more recognizable way of knowing which movies were made by which publisher in the scatterplot visualization other than by color. For the ring visualization, I wish you could move nodes around but still be connected to the publisher.",
22,NoLinks,Ring,2,2,2,4,6,5,6,4,6,2,They were both interesting to use and a different way to analyze information,nothing,
26,NoLinks,Ring,1,6,2,5,4,1,6,3,5,4,Rings had previous connections,Scatterplot involved searching for colorbased objects,
34,NoLinks,Ring,6,5,4,4,5,6,3,6,6,5,"In the scatterplot visualization, I liked the ability to drag nodes aside, this helped me find connections between nodes faster. ","The ring visualization is very organized, but can get messy when looking at links between multiple nodes.",
38,NoLinks,Ring,6,6,6,2,6,5,2,2,6,6,They were visually pleasing and able to be manipulated,It was difficult to rotate them at times and select things.,Overall I liked it a lot.
5,Links,Ring,2,6,1,5,2,2,6,2,1,1,the ring visualizations are better and more convenient to use,sharp edges on scatterplot are hardly seen,
9,Links,Ring,2,7,1,5,1,1,7,6,1,7,all the connections were pretty easy to find in the ring,scatterplot was a bit complex,
13,Links,Ring,2,6,3,6,3,3,6,3,2,2,Interface was entertaining,I wanted to sit down,
17,Links,Ring,6,1,4,1,6,5,3,5,4,4,"I liked that in the ring visualization you could rotate the rings. I liked that in the scatterplot you could see more easily what was connected or what was just a single point completely disconnected. also in the scatterplot the movies were more evenly spaced so you could see them better, or even stand inside the visualization and look around.","in the ring, it was easy to get distracted by the rings and feel like those were connections when they are not. the scatterplot lacked the ability to rotate by company so it was harder to easily group them.",
21,Links,Ring,2,6,4,6,2,4,6,2,7,7,"The ring was good for seeing differences between publishers since all the movies from the same publisher were connected.  The scatterplot was harder to use, but allowed you to group movies how you chose instead of just by publisher.  The scatterplot definitely took more time to use, but could group movies by many more categories.","It was difficult to compare movies in ways other than  by publisher with the ring.  The scatterplot required a lot more manipulation to group movies and could not be reset to the default.  This meant that for each grouping, you had to start over.  I also found that after each grouping, all the vertexes kept getting farther and farther apart and made it harder to read and use.",
25,Links,Ring,5,2,6,4,5,6,5,3,5,7,The Ring visualization was more organized. The Scatterplot allowed to isolate and distinguish specific items better.,"The ring had obtuse and difficult to see connections between movies. In the Scatterplot visualization, it becomes difficult to discern individual items.","I found it difficult to clearly see each item regardless of visualization, I feel like my poor eyesight contributed to this."
29,Links,Ring,6,3,6,2,6,3,3,6,7,7,Scatterplot allows manipulation of node positions which is better. Ring made it easier to identify related entities via publishers,Rotations in the various rings were slightly less intuitive. Scatterplot was disorganized.,
33,Links,Ring,6,2,6,6,7,2,2,7,4,5,They definitely were more interactive,The colors and the general representation. It was hard to tell the highlighted portions from the unlighted portion apart. ,
37,Links,Ring,2,7,1,7,2,2,7,1,7,6,I enjoyed the many different functions I could do.,"Confusing, there seemed to be way too much going on ",
41,Links,Ring,5,4,6,1,6,5,3,6,2,3,"Interesting way of connecting seemingly unrelated movies, scalability of the graphs","Hard to differentiate colors, not clearly labeled, can be difficult to rotate, hard to find intersections of publishers in both",Add brightly highlighted lines/connections from scatterplot to the ring
4,NoLinks,Node,1,7,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,1,They are easy to analyze,Complexity,Had A experience of virtual reality for first time
12,NoLinks,Node,1,6,2,6,2,2,6,2,2,2,"I really like rotating the ring, I like walking though the scatterplot","neither have search function and no feedback to show whether you have checked this movie before. In the scatter, I could not differentiate publisher and movies",maybe some bias because I first use scatterplot and then ring
16,NoLinks,Node,1,7,1,7,2,1,6,2,2,2,"Ring: The color coding of the publishers was more clear and I appreciated the fact that they were pre-grouped along the ring. Being able to cycle through the movies by a single publisher on the right was exceptionally helpful, and was unavailable in the scatterplot visualization. Resizing the ring allowed for  different experiences with the data (e.g., standing inside it, having it be a small ball in front of you) and allowed me to visualize the data in different ways. Both: The sizing of the text (large for publishers, smaller for movies) was excellent.","Ring: Selection of individual notes was difficult.  Selection of nodes at the point where all the rings converge was particularly difficult, as I could not tell what line the nodes lay on, and therefore did not know which ring to rotate to get the node out of the convergence point. Scatterplot: The disorganized data made it difficult to work with. Both:  The difference in the colors could be more prominent.",
20,NoLinks,Node,3,3,4,6,4,6,5,3,6,6,With the ring everything was easier to see and locate. But the scatter plot was more fun.,It was hard to find check all connections on the scatter plot. And the remotes glitched sometimes using the ring while I was facing the opposite direction,Very intuitive and engaging. Will remember the experience   
24,NoLinks,Node,1,7,1,5,1,1,5,1,1,1,I like how  both visualizations allowed you to see connections between movies. The ring visualization made it easier to see the connections.,The scatter plot visualization was a little too complex for me and the nodes were in various places.,
28,NoLinks,Node,1,7,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,1,The ring and scatterplot visualizations were very interactive. ,The text on the bottom was blur. ,Had Fun.
30,NoLinks,Node,7,1,7,4,7,7,1,2,4,7,"Ring allowed me to easily see all of the movies from each publisher, scatterplot had everything more spread out which made it easier to analyze",Ring had a lot of things close together and it was hard to analyze all of the lines. Scatterplot was a little difficult to move around and see each point clearly,
32,NoLinks,Node,2,7,7,5,6,6,2,6,7,7,"Ring visualization is easy to tell the relationship between the movies and publishers, since the movie that has the same producer was on the same ring. Scatterplot can see the connection between movies that share the same actors better.","For ring, it is pretty confused to see the common actors between movies because the globe shape. Scatterplot is not so easy to see the relationship with producers. ",I personally prefer the scatterplot because it is more fun. But ring visualization helps when you want to find out which movie shares the same producer. 
36,NoLinks,Node,2,6,1,3,3,2,5,2,5,3,It was amazing viewing the information all around you. It was fun finding the information and separating it from the rest. The ring kept everything a lot more organized.,There was so much info everywhere and it took too much time to find the movies and count them/find their links. Also it took to long to move the rings around and get from one place to the other.,"Try giving the person an option to write down notes (when counting how many movies there are, etc). It looks great and there is a lot of potential for VR in education. The classroom would be more interactive, but it might also be too distracting and too long."
40,NoLinks,Node,2,2,2,6,2,2,6,2,2,2,the immersion,time consuming to find data,listen to comments in video for suggestions in the moment
3,Links,Node,1,4,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,1,The ability to scale the visualization and rotate data points,Our inability to shift the graphs relative to our position. ,
7,Links,Node,1,7,1,7,1,1,7,1,4,7,They were a new way to visualize large amount of data in an interactive way,They could both be a little difficult to understand at first,I think this is a very interesting way to view data and think with some minor changes can be very helpful
8,Links,Node,2,7,2,7,1,3,7,1,3,2,Pointing on one node connects to other nodes was very interesting for me.,Scatterplots tend be at large distances so finding a connection was difficult.,
11,Links,Node,1,6,1,6,1,1,6,1,1,1,Ring: All the movies of a publisher are organized on a ring. Scatterplot: could be easy to find the no of connected actors because of lengths,scatterPlot: Too much of data to analyze in this form of presentation.  But the same graph was better in ring form to analyze as it was more organized,
15,Links,Node,2,5,1,2,4,2,3,5,1,3,"They were engaging and interactive, which made the tasks more enjoyable. They also illuminated statistics/data in a visually appealing way to make it easier to understand.","Many nodes/lines overlapped (tangled) so it was difficult to grab the right one and differentiate which connection was going where. It became a bit confusing, especially when trying to sort out the largest connections/publishers. ",I really like the concept and I think it has great potential!
19,Links,Node,5,1,7,1,7,7,2,6,6,6,I liked the Scatterplot because it was easier to see connections between nodes. On the ring it was easy to see which publisher the movies belonged to.,The ring was very hard to see connections in between nodes and the scatterplot it was harder to distinguish publishers,
23,Links,Node,1,7,1,7,1,1,7,1,4,4,It is fun to interact with anything glowing and beautiful.,It was easy to accidentally slip out of rotation with the Rings and it was hard to see the text in the Scatterplot.,I needed an ability to scale the font size.
27,Links,Node,2,2,4,4,3,2,6,2,1,1,"The ring had much more rigid grouping by producer so it was much easier to identify a movie by category and made it easier to find basic information such as the number of movies a producer produced, and made the number of connections more apparent. The scatterplot was slightly easier to follow the lines to different movies, but I had difficulty due to the large number of elements.","For the number of elements, the grouping provided by the scatterplot was not enough to quickly identify an individual movie. The ring visualization seemed better for this data set, but I sometimes accidentally moved the entire sphere as opposed to the ring I was attempting to move.","The data visualizations were definitely helpful in showing number of connections and some general trends but it was much more difficult to actually find some of the movies, having some voice commands to do simple search's as well as a means to take notes would have been very helpful. "
31,Links,Node,1,7,1,7,1,1,7,1,1,1,"ring had nodes in one circle which were easy to use and understand
Even when rotating , I could see the movement which was good",there was no legend. The last question required too many interconnections which is difficult to find ,"If thread also can move along with nodes, that will be easy to get the answer"
35,Links,Node,2,2,2,5,2,2,6,2,2,2,I liked that they were colorful and interactive,"Dizzing, text of movies was a little small",
39,Links,Node,7,4,7,1,7,4,1,7,7,7,"the ability to interact with them in a virtual space with your hands, fun to play with",a bit complex to see links ,
