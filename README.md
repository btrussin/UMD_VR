Initial scene is in 'Assets/R62V/UMDSphere/SphereScene.unity'

So far, the only buttons that do anything are the grip buttons (two to scale, one to translate) and the menu buttons (toggle through various layouts)

Pressing the trigger button on the left controller (when not inside of a sphere) will bring up the menu to change the layout of the sphere.
